# React Native Vector Icons Implementation

## Overview
Successfully updated the React Native app to use MaterialCommunityIcons from react-native-vector-icons library for improved visual consistency and modern design.

## Platform Configuration

### Android Setup
- ✅ Created fonts directory: `android/app/src/main/assets/fonts/`
- ✅ Copied all vector icon font files (19 font families including MaterialCommunityIcons.ttf)

### iOS Setup  
- ✅ Added UIAppFonts configuration to `ios/CityAtApp/Info.plist` with all 19 font families

### ServicesScreen Categories

## Visual Improvements
- ✅ More appropriate icons for each service category (e.g., pipe-wrench for plumbing vs generic water-drop)

- ✅ Better visual representation matching service types
- ✅ Professional appearance with high-quality vector icons

## Files Modified
- `src/screens/home/HomeScreen.tsx`
- `src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx` 
- `src/screens/services/ServicesScreen.tsx`
- `src/setupTests.ts`
- `ios/CityAtApp/Info.plist`

## Icon Library Benefits
- ✅ MaterialCommunityIcons provides more specific icons for each service category
- ✅ Consistent design language across the app
- ✅ Better semantic meaning (hammer-screwdriver for carpentry vs generic handyman)
- ✅ Outline variants for navigation provide cleaner interface
- ✅ Scalable vector graphics for all screen densities
